TASK 2: CHAT APPLICATION DESCRIPTION 

As part of my internship, I successfully developed a real-time chat application with full frontend and backend integration. The application allows multiple users to join specific chat rooms, exchange messages instantly, and view active participants within the room — all updated in real-time using WebSocket technology via Socket.IO.

The project was built using Node.js and Express on the backend to handle server operations and real-time communication. I used Socket.IO to establish bi-directional communication between the server and clients, enabling features like broadcasting messages, handling user join/leave events, and maintaining active user lists. Core backend logic was organized in separate utility modules for managing users and formatting messages, ensuring clean and modular code.

On the frontend, I created two primary HTML pages — one for joining the chat room and another for the chat interface itself. The UI was designed using HTML, CSS (custom styles via main.css), and vanilla JavaScript for handling DOM manipulation and socket event responses. I integrated libraries such as Font Awesome for UI icons and Qs for parsing URL parameters passed between pages.

The folder structure followed best practices, separating concerns across public assets (HTML, CSS, JS), utility logic (utils), and server configuration (server.js). The application was structured to dynamically serve files using Express' static middleware, ensuring smooth routing and file access.

Development was carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary editor, leveraging its integrated terminal and extension support for efficient code execution and debugging.

This chat application is applicable in various real-world scenarios where real-time communication is essential — such as customer support chat systems, team collaboration tools, virtual classrooms, or multiplayer gaming lobbies. It demonstrates foundational principles of event-driven programming, socket-based networking, and modular full-stack development.
